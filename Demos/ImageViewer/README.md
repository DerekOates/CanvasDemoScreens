# Image Viewer

This is a simple screen I wrote that browses images within a folder on a hard drive. Its main purpose was to test the image viewer to ensure compatibility with a wide variety of image types, but I have received feedback that it is an interesting screen so I thought I'd post it here.

You type in the directory you want to view -- in this case, `C:\Pictures` -- and click "Load Images". Then all the images show up in the dropdown at the bottom. After selecting an image, if the dropdown is still the active element, images will load by pressing the up or down arrow.

Please note that there may be a slight delay while loading images, since the entire image is loaded from disk when you select an option.
